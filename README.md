Hi everyone,
I have created an interactive dashboard using Tableau.
You can see my dashboard by clicking on "Tableau Analysis Cricket" file using Tableau application.
All the datasets used in the project are stored in C10_Input-Files.
  *dim_match_summary dataset : Gives you an information about the teams played on a particular day and who was the winner and a unique match id an finally
  by how many runs or wickets did the team win.
  *dim_players dataset : Gives you information about the team players whether he is batsmen or bowler or all rounder and to which team they belong to.
  *fact_batting_summary dataset : Gives you information about all the batsmen only such as their runs scored.
  *fact_bowling_summary dataset : Gives you information about all the bowlers only such as number of wickets taken.
I have also used an image of IPL to use it min my dashboard.
You can also watch a demo video of my dashboard by clicking on "Demo Video" file.
